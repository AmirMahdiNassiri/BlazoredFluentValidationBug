# BlazoredFluentValidationBug
This repo contains a minimal source project to reproduce an issue reported for [Blazored.FluentValidation](https://github.com/Blazored/FluentValidation/issues/76) package. Thankfully, the issue is now resolved.

I genuinely appreciate the work done by the authors of [FluentValidation](https://github.com/FluentValidation/FluentValidation) and its Blazor port by the [Blazored.FluentValidation](https://github.com/Blazored/FluentValidation) package.
Thanks for making the life of a Blazor developer easier! Cheers üçª #_+
